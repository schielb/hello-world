# hello-world
This is my first attempt at a repository on GitHub

I recognize the various necessities of being familiar with repositories and how they can be useful for teams working on projects
  together, and so I am going to give it my all to become acquainted with this over the course of my summer and the various 
  different things I can do. I hope to have a lot of fun witht he many things I learn over the cours of my time of self exploration!
  (And look at that, it automatically indents, I was wondering about that for like a whole half-second!)
